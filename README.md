# Library Management System
This happens to be my senior year CS final project in high school. We were required to build something based on the stuff we learnt in junior and senior years in C++.

Although, this isn't the best piece of code I have written, it still is one of the things I spent a lot of time in 2016. I've not made any changes after the submission nor am I expecting to work on this later.
